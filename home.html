            <h2>My Social Media</h2>
            <p>I don't have any social media pages, nor do I want one.  Not even a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> page.  Maybe one day I'll get around to
                creating one but I haven't felt the need to do so yet.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Like to Do</h2>
            <p>I am on a computer for work and most days that I have free time.  I enjoy coding and seeing what I can learn.</p>
