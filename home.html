        <h2>My Job</h2>
        <p>
            I work for <a href="http://www.rocketmortgage.com">Rocket Mortgage</a> as a Senior Software Engineer.  I have worked there for 6 years and work in
            the <a href="http://www.progress.com">Progress</a> programming language.  My goal is to learn C# and become proficient in the .Net world of code.
        </p>

        <h2>My Social Media</h2>
        <p>I actually don't have any social media pages.  Not even a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> page.  Maybe one day I'll get around to
            creating one but I haven't felt the need to do so yet.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Like to Do</h2>
        <p>I am on a computer for work and most days that I have free time.  I enjoy coding and seeing what I can learn.</p>
